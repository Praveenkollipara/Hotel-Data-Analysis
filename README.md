# Hotel-Data-Analysis

## Project Overview  
The objective of this data project was to develop a comprehensive database to analyze and visualize hotel booking data. By analyzing various aspects of the bookings data, I seek to identify trends, make data-driven recommendations, and answer several questions of the stakeholders.

## Data Sources
Hotel Bookings Data : The dataset used for this analysis is "hotel_revenue_historical_full-2.xlsx".

## Tools
- SQL Server - Data Cleaning and Analysis
- PowerBI - Creating Reports

## Methodology:
### Step 1 : Database Development
Starting the project, I utilized Microsoft SQL Server to create a database that could accommodate the provided data. The data consisted of multiple years, including 2018, 2019, and 2020. Additionally, we had data on meal costs and market segments. We imported the relevant data from Excel sheets into the SQL database for further analysis.

### Step 2: SQL Query Development
Once the database was set up, I proceeded to develop SQL queries to extract the required information. This involved utilizing various SQL functions such as JOIN, SUM, and GROUP BY to retrieve the necessary data for analysis.

### Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involved exploring the hotel bookings data to answer key questions, such as:
- Is our hotel revenue growing yearly?
- Should we increase our parking lot size?
- What trends can we see in the data?

### Step 4: Power BI Integration
To visualize the data and gain meaningful insights, we connected Power BI to the SQL database. This integration allowed me to create interactive and visually appealing visualizations for effective data exploration.

### Step 5: Data Visualization
Using Power BI's visualization capabilities, I created charts, graphs, and dashboards to represent the hotel booking data. These visualizations enabled stakeholders to understand the patterns, trends, and relationships within the data.

## Results/Findings Summary
Based on the analysis and visualizations, the following key findings were identified:

1. Revenue Growth: The total revenue generated by the hotels between 2018 and 2020 was approximately $29.12 million. The City Hotel accounted for 51.67% of the revenue, while the Resort Hotel contributed 48.33%.

2. Parking Lot Size: There was no correlation between the number of parking spaces and its impact on guest bookings. Therefore, increasing the parking lot size may not be necessary based on the available data.

3. Trends in the Data: Both hotels experienced their highest revenue between July 2019 and January 2020. However, this growth was significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdown measures, which severely affected the hospitality industry.

4. Revenue Segmentation: The revenue was segmented by hotel type, with the City Hotel and Resort Hotel accounting for different proportions of the total revenue. Further analysis can be conducted to identify specific trends and patterns within each hotel type.

5. Guest Preferences: The data did not provide substantial insights into trends related to guest preferences for personal cars. This aspect may require additional data or analysis to gain a more comprehensive understanding.

6. Seasonality in Income: The average daily rate for hotel bookings was approximately $105 USD, and the total number of nights used was around 370. Seasonal variations in income can be explored further to understand the impact of different periods on overall revenue.

## Recommendations:
Based on the findings, the following recommendations are suggested:

1. Revenue Diversification: Due to the significant impact of external factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic, it is recommended to explore avenues for revenue diversification. This could involve offering additional services or targeting different market segments to mitigate potential future disruptions.

2. Market Segment Analysis: Further analysis should be conducted to identify specific trends and patterns within different market segments. This information can guide marketing and promotional efforts to maximize revenue potential.

3. Continuous Monitoring: Given the dynamic nature of the hospitality industry, it is crucial to establish a system for continuous monitoring of key performance indicators (KPIs) such as revenue, occupancy rates, and average daily rates. This will enable timely decision-making and proactive measures to respond to changing market conditions.

## Conclusion:
In conclusion, the data project successfully developed a database and analyzed and visualized hotel booking data to address the stakeholders' questions. The findings revealed that the total revenue from the hotels over the analyzed period was approximately $29.12 million, with the City Hotel contributing 51.67% and the Resort Hotel contributing 48.33% of the revenue. The average daily rate was around $105 USD, and the highest revenue was generated between July 2019 and January 2020, before being affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdown measures.

However, there was no significant correlation observed between the number of parking spaces and its impact on guest bookings. Therefore, increasing the parking lot size may not be necessary based on the available data.

To further enhance revenue generation, it is recommended to focus on revenue diversification strategies to mitigate potential future disruptions. Exploring additional services and targeting different market segments can help achieve this goal. Additionally, conducting an in-depth analysis of market segments can provide valuable insights to guide marketing and promotional efforts.

Continuous monitoring of key performance indicators such as revenue, occupancy rates, and average daily rates is crucial to adapt to changing market conditions and make informed decisions.

In conclusion, the data project provided valuable insights into hotel booking data, enabling stakeholders to understand revenue trends, evaluate parking lot size requirements, and identify the impact of external factors on the hospitality industry. The recommendations emphasize revenue diversification, market segment analysis, and continuous monitoring to drive long-term success and adaptability in a dynamic industry.
